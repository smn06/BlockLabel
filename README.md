### Key Features:
- **Decentralized Labeling:** Distributes labeling tasks across a network of nodes, ensuring a decentralized and tamper-resistant labeling process.
  
- **Immutable Audit Trail:** Utilizes blockchain's immutable ledger to create a transparent and traceable history of data labeling activities, promoting accountability and integrity.

- **Smart Contracts:** Implements smart contracts to automate labeling agreements, ensuring fair compensation and efficient task management.

- **Data Privacy:** Prioritizes data privacy with secure encryption and permissioned access, maintaining confidentiality while allowing transparency in the labeling process.

## Getting Started:

### Prerequisites:
